      <p>Villarrica  (Spanish: Volcán Villarrica, Mapudungun: Ruka Pillañ) is one of Chile's most active 
        volcanoes, rising above the lake and town of the same name, 750 km (470 mi) south of Santiago.[2] It is also known as Rucapillán, a Mapuche word meaning 
        "great spirit's house". It is the westernmost of three large stratovolcanoes that trend northwest to southeast obliquely perpendicular to the Andean chain 
        along the Mocha-Villarrica Fault Zone,[3] 
        along with Quetrupillán and the Chilean portion of Lanín, are protected within Villarrica National Park. Guided ascents are popular during summer months.</p>
